# Genesis Dynamik Image Rotator
Select a bunch of background images to use in random rotation within the header of a Genesis Dynamik theme (the bit behind the logo and header widget area). Images to be used need to uploaded with the Dynamik Image Uploader. The next version of this plugin will rotate images in other theme sections too. Image rotation occurs on each page load.

# Instructions
- Download Genesis Dynamik Image Rotator.
- Install as you would any other WordPress plugin by going to Dashboard > Plugins > Upload
- Activate the plugin then click 'Settings' under the plugin name or go to Dashboard > Genesis > Genesis Dynamik Image Rotator.
- Select images to display as the header background in random rotation then click 'Activate Selection' to make it happen.
- The images are set to be contained within the header area. For best results choose images that are appropriately sized for the header area, do not select a header image within Dynamik Settings > Header > Background Image (use this plugn instead).
- Set the height of the header using Dynamik Settings > Header.

# Roadmap
* Add options to choose rotation images for different areas of the site.
* Add option to auto adjust header height to match the image.
* Add CSS override options.
* Unhook any existing background image set within Dynamik.
* More
